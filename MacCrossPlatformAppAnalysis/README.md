# macOS Cross-Platform Application Analysis

This guide explains how to analyze your application's performance across both macOS and Windows platforms using Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA). 

By using the Microsoft Performance Tools for Apple, you can capture traces on macOS and analyze them alongside Windows traces in WPA, enabling direct performance comparisons across platforms.

## Overview

The [Microsoft Performance Tools for Apple](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Performance-Tools-Apple) project enables developers to:
- Analyze Apple Instruments traces using the same tools as Windows traces
- Compare performance metrics across platforms consistently
- Use familiar WPA analysis techniques for macOS applications
- Understand performance characteristics in cross-platform scenarios

## Key Benefits

- **Unified Analysis**: Use the same tool (WPA) to analyze traces from both platforms
- **Consistent Methodology**: Apply identical analysis techniques across Windows and macOS
- **Cross-Platform Insights**: Directly compare performance metrics between platforms
- **Familiar Tools**: Leverage existing knowledge of WPA for macOS analysis

## Available Analysis Features

The tools support analysis of:
- Time Profile data
- CPU Counters
- Instruction and cycle-level metrics
- Thread sampling
- Performance counter data

## Getting Started
